# Counter

Simple counter app to play with Android Widgets. It used to be in Google Play but I didn't update it for years so it was removed :)  
There were few types of counters:
- simple "tap to increment" 
- with +/- buttons
- counting down untill date 

User could also pick widget colors and edit them inside the app. There was also screen for statistics of increments in time.
